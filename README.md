We attempt to handpick a few among myriad of variables that have significant impact on the change in stock price.

Step 1: Formulate Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between company fundamentals (such as earnings per share, revenue growth, debt-to-equity ratio) and stock prices.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant relationship between company fundamentals and stock prices.

Step 2: Data Collection and Preparation
Collect Data:

Obtain historical stock price data for the companies of interest.
Gather financial statement data including earnings per share (EPS), revenue growth, debt-to-equity ratio, etc.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Ensure consistency in the timeframes of stock price data and financial statement data.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics for stock prices and company fundamentals.
Examine distributions, central tendencies, and variability.
Data Visualization:

Plot time series graphs of stock prices and company fundamentals.
Explore correlations between variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

Step 4: Hypothesis Testing
Correlation Analysis:

Perform correlation analysis between stock prices and company fundamentals.
Use techniques such as Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
Regression Analysis:

Build regression models to quantify the relationship between stock prices (dependent variable) and company fundamentals (independent variables).
Choose appropriate regression techniques based on the nature of the data (linear regression, multiple regression, etc.).
Assess the significance of regression coefficients and goodness of fit.

Step 5: Statistical Inference
Hypothesis Testing:

Conduct hypothesis tests to determine if the relationship between company fundamentals and stock prices is statistically significant.
Use techniques such as t-tests or ANOVA to compare means or regression coefficients.
Significance Level:

Choose a significance level (usually Î± = 0.05) to evaluate the p-values obtained from hypothesis tests.
If the p-value is less than the significance level, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

Step 6: Interpretation and Conclusion
Interpret Results:

Interpret the findings from statistical analysis and regression models.
Discuss the magnitude and direction of relationships between variables.
Conclusion:

Based on the statistical analysis, conclude whether there is evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
Discuss implications for investors or stakeholders in the context of financial decision-making.

Step 7: Report Writing
Structure your report:

Introduction: Background information and objectives.
Data Collection and Preparation: Details of datasets used and preprocessing steps.
Analysis and Results: Description of statistical analysis techniques used and key findings.
Discussion: Interpretation of results, limitations, and future directions.
Conclusion: Summary of findings and implications.
Visualizations:

Include relevant graphs, charts, and tables to visualize key findings and relationships.
References:

Cite sources for datasets, statistical methods, and relevant literature.
By following these steps, you can systematically investigate the relationship between company fundamentals and stock prices, conduct appropriate statistical analysis, and draw meaningful conclusions to address your hypothesis.
